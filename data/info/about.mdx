# About us

> We at Tensight believe that there are countless untold stories of amazing athletic achievement and feat.

I love sports, and it's been a big part of my identity as a Japanese-American who grew up in Los Angeles. I think there are stories to be told demographically of a widely misunderstood group of families to a large section of America.

Many centuries ago, the Olympics event itself was founded with the intention of promoting world peace, and I think it has certainly given many people the chance to see the cultures of other countries.

There's many missed opportunities to highlight stories that happen locally within communities. Just as an example, Wataru Misaka was the first player of Asian descent in the NBA, and this was back in 1947. He also led the University of Utah to an NCAA Championship. 

So why is there some kind of unspoken uneasiness regarding Asian athleticism within basketball and many other sports? Normalizing this kind of language is a big part of the mission of this project.

## What does "Tensight" mean?

In case you’re curious, the name “Tensight” is a play on several things: the first is a pun on the Japanese term 天才, or “ten-sai”, meaning “genius, natural gift” — a fitting phrase to describe the athletes on this site.

If that’s not enough for you, the second is a play on the English term “foresight”, and that while people with “4-sight” may be able to see 4 steps into the future, “10-sight” will be able to see even further (it's a work in progress).

## Standing on the shoulders of giants

This project and collective is a culmination of the hard-work journalists and sports fans across the world contributing to this knowledge-base.

* [The Undefeated](https://theundefeated.com/) is an incredible publication that has championed this idea from the get-go. [Cary Chow](https://theundefeated.com/contributors/cary-chow/) is an incredible journalist and I look up to him tremendously. I'm hoping that I can somehow follow the path he's laid out.

## Personal note

Thank you for taking the time to come to this corner of the vast internet to learn about the athletes of the past, the present, and the future.

Cheers,

Alex N., Project Founder
